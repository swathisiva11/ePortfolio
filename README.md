# Professional Self-Assessment  
Over the course of my Computer Science program at SNHU, I have grown not only as a developer but also as a project-focused problem solver. This ePortfolio showcases the technical and professional progress I‚Äôve made by highlighting artifacts that demonstrate my capabilities in software development, algorithm design, data analysis, and system architecture. These projects and the enhancements I‚Äôve completed reflect my readiness to contribute to real-world software projects as either a developer or a project coordinator (roles that align with my concentration in project management).

## My Strenghths and Professional Growth
Throughout the program, I developed core technical skills such as full-stack web development using Angular, Express, and MongoDB; writing clean, testable code; and implementing algorithms and data-driven features that improve software performance and user experience. Just as importantly, I strengthened my ability to manage projects holistically from breaking down problems and planning enhancements to executing and validating code.

Through this ePortfolio, I am able to reflect on my learning and development. My enhancements reflect an evolution in how I think about software from simply ‚Äúmaking it work‚Äù to making it reliable, efficient, scalable, and understandable. I‚Äôve also grown more confident in testing, debugging, and communicating technical decisions clearly, which are important for both solo work and team collaboration.

### Collaboration and Communication
One of my strengths is the ability to bridge technical detail and high-level goals. In my coursework, I often had to communicate design choices and trade-offs in both technical and non-technical contexts. I learned how to adapt documentation and presentations depending on whether I was addressing teammates, instructors, or simulated stakeholders. My code review video, as well as my written narratives, demonstrate my ability to clearly explain system functionality, propose improvements, and justify enhancement decisions using best practices and sound logic.

Although most of my coursework was completed independently, I also developed collaborative skills through group projects and by learning to follow team-oriented workflows. For example, I adopted version control practices with Git and GitHub that mirror those used in professional environments. These experiences have prepared me to work smoothly in cross-functional teams where communication and clarity are as important as code quality.

## Summary of Artifacts
My artifact enhancements represent my technical depth in each of the following three key computer science categories. 
- **Software Design and Engineering**: I enhanced a full-stack application by building a dynamic Trip Detail View, implementing new frontend-backend communication patterns, and introducing robust unit and integration testing. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to design and maintain scalable, modular systems using Angular, Node.js, and testing frameworks.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: I implemented a custom keyword-based search algorithm that ranks trip results by relevance. This required careful use of arrays, maps, and efficient sorting logic, and showcased my understanding of algorithmic trade-offs and data manipulation within the backend.
- **Databases**: I created a Trip Popularity Analysis feature using MongoDB‚Äôs aggregation pipeline. This feature captures real user behavior and surfaces it in the UI, combining backend analytics with frontend display. It reflects my ability to work with real-world data and deliver actionable insights.

### How My Artifacts Work Together
Each artifact in this portfolio is based on the same core project, which is a full stack travel site, but represents a different enhancement that maps to a specific course outcome. This intentional reuse allows me to demonstrate layered improvements within a cohesive system. As you move through my portfolio, you‚Äôll see how I built on my original work to make it more modular, searchable, data-driven, and insight-rich. Together, these artifacts represent not just a series of assignments but a holistic demonstration of my skillset in action.


## üîß Projects

### 1. Full Stack Development
**Description**: In this project, I implemented several types of frontend development, including static HTML files, server-rendered pages using Express with Handlebars templates, and a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) built using Angular.
